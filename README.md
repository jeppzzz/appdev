# My Top 3 Favorite Movies/Series

1. Real Steel  
2. Prison Break  
3. Hunter x Hunter  

- **Real Steel** because it feels so realistic for an older movie. When I first watched it as a kid, it was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen. It’s still nostalgic every time I rewatch it.  
- **Prison Break** is one of the best and longest series I’ve watched. I think I’ve rewatched it fully two or three times already. It’s definitely a 10/10 from start to finish.  
- **Hunter x Hunter** is unique because, unlike many modern anime where fights are full of dialogue, this one treats enemies as real threats. There’s no unnecessary talking, just pure action and strategy, which makes it so enjoyable to watch.
